#### Thai Coconut Sweet Rice Orgeat

- 1/3 cup Thai Sweet Rice
- 1.5 L water

  > Soak rice for at least 30 minutes under water, then drain to cook.
  > Bring water & rice to a boil, immediately lower temp to medium to simmer for 30 minutes.
  > While simmering, use an immersion blender to fully integrate & blend in the sweet rice -- takes about 5-10 minutes.
  > Remove from heat and allow to cool a bit before adding in Cream of Coconut. While cooling make the Cream of Coconut.

- 50 g Cream of Coconut
  - In particular, I utilized JBUG's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HjRrQ8nUBAdkEyhP7AbH442cavyeje88eW9y9YzTrQg/edit" target="_blank">**_Cream of Coconut recipe_**</a> (John Brown's Underground - iconic cocktail bar in Lawrence, KS)
  - JBUG's **_Coconut Cream/Cream of Coconut recipe_** is on the right-hand side of their Ramos Fizz recipe document.
    > ##### Cream of Coconut (JBUG recipe; cut in half)
    >
    > - 1/2 can (~6 oz.) unsweetened coconut milk
    > - 250 g sugar (white, granulated)
    > - 15 mL pure coconut extract/tincture (I use organic)
    > - 1.5 tsp table salt
    >   > Add all ingredients besides coconut extract to a blender and blend until combined, about 1 minute.
    >   > Once all combined, then add and stir in coconut extract while the rice mixture is still a bit warm.
